# Introduction

This application is a simple graphical interface atop of great [smem](https://github.com/kwkroeger/smem) tool by Kurt Kroeger. It does not aim to provide all the features of smem command.
I made this tool to easily visualize the "real memory" consumption of processes. For each process, PID, RSS, PSS and USS are displayed. The more realistic process memory consumption is given by PSS field which counts the process private memory plus the proportion of shared memory accountable to this process.
You're allowed to filter processes by name and visualize the total memory occupied by filtered processes.
